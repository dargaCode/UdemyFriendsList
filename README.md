# Post Route Test
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS/JS+Node.js+Express.js</strong>

After a fairly long detour into my first OSS contribution and setting up build systems, I’m back learning Express and server-side.

This small project builds on what I’ve done so far, and also includes the ability to send information through a POST request.

New friends are are persistent between page loads, but only so long as the server stays running.

Next, I’ll learn learn how to add in a database to save data permanently!
